# Covid-19-Vaccine
Covid-19 has been a virus that shook our country and our world. The health sector, economy and tourism sector of the countries have been adversely affected by this virus. Health, economy and tourism are interlinked. Citizens have been highly affected by the loss of their lives, the loss of their families' relatives or permanent damage to their bodies due to the Covid-19 virus. Countries have implemented closures taking into account the economic conditions. With closures for about 15-20 days, citizens were banned from going out on the streets, only the places where compulsory items such as markets can be bought open. There is only one solution to this epidemic, which affects the whole world so badly. To vaccinate all people in the world. When the epidemic started to spread, scientists started vaccination studies. As a result of long studies, some countries were successful in vaccination studies and these vaccines were offered for sale. Thus, a new problem arose. Vaccine wars. Countries have entered the race to vaccinate their citizens. Low-populated or developed countries have vaccinated their entire population. But developing countries and countries with a high population like us have trouble finding vaccines. Getting vaccines brings along a certain economic problem. Of course, the citizen suffers from this situation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the studies conducted by countries for vaccination within the scope of Covid-19. Questions such as which countries have vaccinated all their citizens, what is the status of vaccination in our country, will be sought with data visualization. Questions such as which countries have vaccinated all their citizens, what is the status of vaccination in our country, will be sought with data visualization. There are many people who are victims of the vaccine. One of these people is my mother. Since Covid started, she was afraid to even go to the grocery store because my mother had diabetes, blood pressure and kidney disease. His social life has disappeared. We took care to constantly wash everything we bought from outside, not to accept guests at home, and not to go out except when forced to leave. This situation started to get boring after a while. He has been waiting to be vaccinated for 1 year. There are many people waiting for the vaccine, like my mother. Vaccination of all countries brings citizens back to their normal lives. They don't have to live with fear. In this study, we will see how quickly countries were able to intervene in the difficulties faced by citizens and in how long did they vaccinate all their citizens.
# Inroduction
As Covid-19 started to spread rapidly around the world, scientists entered the race to find an effective vaccine against Covid-19. China started vaccination studies while it did not receive official approval for the vaccine. In August, 24 vaccines were checked and 6 of them successfully completed the controls. In August 2020, Russia developed a vaccine called Gam-COVID-Vac. However, it was not applied because it could not be proven what kind of effect the vaccine had for Covid-19 Virus. The first vaccine in Turkey was given to Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca. Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were made in Turkey. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive emergency use approval and regular use approval. Analyzes show that the vaccine is 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease. First, healthcare professionals in Turkey were vaccinated. Later, citizens aged 65 and over who were in the risk group were vaccinated. Subsequently, the age groups were gradually reduced and vaccination was performed.

The Story Of Problem

With the increase of Covid-19 Virus, the number of scientists trying to find a vaccine has increased. Some are continuing these studies for world health, but some scientists are conducting vaccination studies because of their economic interests. Considering these concerns, false statements emerged in the media. Most news organizations have started to spread rumors that a chip will be placed in our body with the vaccine. With these rumors, some citizens do not want to be vaccinated. On the other hand, some citizens did not want to be vaccinated because they did not know the effects of the vaccine on their bodies. Within these events, vaccination studies have slowed somewhat. Turkey acted quickly in procuring vaccines and bought vaccines from China, but soon after, the vaccine problem occurred in the world. Countries wanted to buy vaccines but could not supply them. Thus, the process was prolonged. Many citizens, like my mother, have been victims of the prolonged process. Schools have switched to distance education, and citizens from many sectors such as craftsmen and farmers have suffered due to the prohibitions. The country's economy collapsed due to the prolongation of the vaccine supply phase and the slow vaccination in the country. Other countries have completed the vaccination, although Turkey could not do this despite vaccinating all its citizens. The competition in both the population of the country and the supply of vaccines did not allow this. Citizens are afraid of leaving their homes for more than 1 year and have no social life. In this study, I focused on my mother. My mother's social life is over for the last 1 year. She even does grocery shopping online due to her chronic illnesses. With the data I collected, I examined the vaccination studies of Turkey in detail.

# Visualization Tools

I used the Datawrapper application to visualize the data I collected in my project.

# Data Gathering

I collected Turkey Covid-19 vaccination data for data visualization. I visualized this data with the datawrapper application. I have reached the vaccination data for Turkey from the addresses below.

- I followed Turkey's pandemic process on this chart and accessed the data from this site.

-I have reached the vaccination charts and data in the world on this site. This site contains the graphics of the country you want to see. You can access its graphics and data by selecting the country to be examined. With the help of this site, I have reached Turkey's vaccination data.

# The Challenges Of Data Gathering

Thanks to vaccination, countries have relaxed socially and economically. While I was collecting this vaccination data, I saw that these data were shared on the official pages of other countries. I have reached these data with the help of foreign sources in Turkey. These sources are not the official sources of Turkey. Since the websites I have found contain data from all countries in the world, I had a hard time collecting the data of Turkey. I created an excel file by combining the data from the sources I found. Then I examined this data and used the necessary parts. I took care to use the necessary and correct data for the visualization process.
